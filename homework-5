1. In the video shows, the LED connected to output pins 2 throught 7 list the sketches where will produce the iconic visual 
   effect associated with the night writher Pontiac Trans Am.
2. Because for the Knight Rider 1, it has written code for each LED light, but the for Knight Rider 2, insided of write code for 
   each light, it used {for}. And write inarray.
   
3.  resistor value should be used with the LEDs?

i = LED forward current in Amps (found in the LED datasheet)
Vf = LED forward voltage drop in Volts (found in the LED datasheet)
Vs = supply voltage
R=(Vs-Vf)/i

   What current limiting resistor value should you use if you have one LED and want to power it with a supply voltage of Vs = 3.8V?

To calculate the current limiting resistor, you first need to look in the datasheet (always RTFM first!)
for the LED's recommended forward voltage and forward current specifications. In this example,
they are 3.1V and 30mA respectively. Don't forget to convert all of your units to Volts, Amps, or Ohms! e.g. 1mA = 0.001Amps

If you plug the values into the above equation, you get:

R=(3.8V-3.1V)/0.03A=23.3Ohms

23.3 Ohms might be an odd value to find, so round up to the next highest common value.
